# Anomaly-Detection-Solar-Energy-Production
📌 Introduction
This project aims to detect anomalies or outliers in the energy output data generated by solar panels.
Anomaly detection is important to identify potential issues, such as:

Solar panel damage

Sensor malfunction

Unexpected shading events

🧪 Methodology
The anomaly detection pipeline consists of the following steps:

📥 Data Loading
🔍 Data Exploration
🧹 Data Cleaning
🛠️ Feature Engineering
✂️ Data Splitting
🧠 Model Training (Isolation Forest)
🧾 Model Evaluation
📊 Data Visualization

📈 Result & Analysis
🔎 Visualization:
Anomalies in solar panel energy output are shown in the plot below as red crosses (X) overlaying the cleaned energy bar chart.


🧠 Analysis:
The Isolation Forest model was trained successfully and applied to detect anomalies in solar panel energy output.
The visualization shows data points identified as anomalies, highlighting potential issues or unexpected events.
This case study presents the steps to build an end-to-end anomaly detection system for time-series data, including cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
